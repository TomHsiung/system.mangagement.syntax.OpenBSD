# ro The filesystem is mounted read-only. Not even root can write to it.
# rw The filesystem is mounted read-write.
# nodev Device nodes are not interpreted.
# nosuid setuid files are forbidden.
# noauto OpenBSD won’t automatically mount the filesystem at boot or when running mount -a. This option is useful for removable media drives that might not have media in them, such as CD and USB flash drives.

/*
The fifth field indicates whether dump(8) should back up this filesystem. If this field is 0 (or absent), dump doesn’t routinely back up the filesystem. Otherwise, the number given is the minimum dump level needed to back up the filesystem.

The last field is the pass number. It tells fsck when to check the filesystem during boot. Filesystems with a pass number of 1 are checked first, filesystems with a pass number of 2 are checked second, and so on. A pass number of 0 tells fsck to not check the filesystem during boot. If a filesystem doesn’t have a pass number, it’s equivalent to 0.
